# Online CV

This is the code for my online CV. I must admit, I don’t really know the
difference between a bloody CV, a friggin’ resume and a freakin’ portfolio, so I
just sticked with the word that was the shorter of the three, which, incidentally,
is also the one that we use in French (because it comes from the Latin expression
*curriculum vitae*, which means *course of life*, one less thing to check on
Wikipedia, you’re welcome).
